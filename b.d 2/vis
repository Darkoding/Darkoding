Use Python libraries to visualize the pixel art.

Matplotlib: Great for 2D plotting and creating simple images.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Useful for creating and manipulating images.
NumPy: Useful for handling data arrays and image matrices.

  Interactive Simulations
To make the pixel art interactive, you can use libraries that support more complex visualizations.

Pygame: Useful for creating interactive applications and games, which can be adapted for educational simulations.
Tkinter: Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library can be used for creating simple interfaces.

  Additional Tools and Libraries
Biopython: For handling and analyzing biological data.
PyMOL: For advanced visualization of protein structures.
